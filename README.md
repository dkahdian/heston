Heston Monte Carlo Simulator

An interactive web application modeling the Heston stochastic volatility process for asset pricing using Monte Carlo simulations

The app enables user-defined inputs (e.g., vol of vol, mean reversion rate, asset price), plotted sample paths, and computed statistical averages across trials

The simulation is implemented using Pyodide; and Plotly.js is used to visualize the result.
